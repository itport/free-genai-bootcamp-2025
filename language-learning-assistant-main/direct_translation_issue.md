# YouTube Transcript Download Issue and Workaround

## The Issue

When attempting to download transcripts using a direct YouTube URL, you may encounter access restrictions. For example:

Using a direct URL:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU5ls6mQ3
```

Results in this error:
```
Downloading transcript for video ID: WU5ls6mQ35 
An error occurred: 
Could not retrieve a transcript for the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU5ls6mQ35 ! This is most likely caused by:

Subtitles are disabled for this video

If you are sure that the described cause is not responsible for this error and that a transcript should be retrievable, please create an issue at https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api/issues. Please add which version of youtube_transcript_api you are using and provide the information needed to replicate the error. Also make sure that there are no open issues which already describe your problem!

## Key Findings

<img src="transcript_retrieval_error.png" alt="Transcript Retrieval Error" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:20px auto;display:block;">

Our testing revealed several important patterns in transcript availability:

- Some videos have auto-generated transcripts (like dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- Others have manually created transcripts in multiple languages (like jNQXAC9IVRw)
- Channel IDs are properly handled with appropriate error messages

Test Results:

Testing video ID: dQw4w9WgXcQ
==================================================

Transcript Options for video dQw4w9WgXcQ:
--------------------------------------------------

Manually Created Transcripts:

Testing video ID: jNQXAC9IVRw
==================================================

Transcript Options for video jNQXAC9IVRw:

Transcripts are disabled for this video

This information will help implement fallback methods for transcript retrieval in the main application.

## The Workaround

To resolve this issue, access the video URL with a timestamp parameter as if the video was previously watched up to a certain point:

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU5ls6mQ35s&t=260s
```

This modified URL format successfully initiates the transcript download:
```
Downloading transcript for video ID: WU5ls6mQ35s
```

This workaround helps bypass certain access restrictions and enables successful transcript retrieval.

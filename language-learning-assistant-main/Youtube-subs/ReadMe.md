# YouTube Subtitles API Access Experiment

## Overview
This project represents an experimental attempt to access and download YouTube video subtitles through the official YouTube Data API. The implementation is written in PHP for rapid prototyping and testing purposes.

## Project Status
Currently, the project faces significant practical limitations due to YouTube's OAuth2 authentication requirements. While the code demonstrates the technical approach to accessing subtitles, the OAuth2 authentication process makes testing and practical implementation challenging.

## Technical Details
- **Language**: PHP
- **Authentication**: YouTube Data API with OAuth2
- **Purpose**: Experimental access to YouTube video subtitles

## Project Structure
- `YouTubeSubtitleDownloader.php`: Main implementation file
- `oauth2callback.php`: OAuth2 callback handler
- `example.php`: Usage example

## Limitations
The primary limitation of this implementation is the OAuth2 authentication requirement imposed by YouTube's API. This makes testing and practical usage significantly more complex than anticipated, as each access requires user authentication and authorization.

## Setup Requirements
1. PHP environment
2. Composer for dependency management
3. Google API credentials
4. YouTube Data API access configuration

## Note
This repository serves primarily as a proof-of-concept demonstration of the technical approach to accessing YouTube subtitles via the official API. Due to the OAuth2 requirements, it may not be suitable for production use without significant additional development.

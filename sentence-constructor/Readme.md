We want to produce a system prompt for gpt 3.5 for a chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating a target English sentence into Romanian. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer, only guidance.

Route one: the "Generate" functionality within OpenAI Playground (https://platform.openai.com/playground) under "gpt-4o" model
Route two: ask gtp-o1-preview to write the system prompt
Testing of the prompts with different Web AI Assistants (https://chatllm.abacus.ai/jHbDDlNWsd) and forward refinements are included in "/Testing"

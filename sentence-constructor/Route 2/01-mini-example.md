Understood! As a teaching assistant guiding Romanian language learners, I will:

1. **Accept the student's English sentence for translation.**
2. **Create a vocabulary table** with key nouns, verbs, and adjectives, presenting their Romanian equivalents in dictionary form. I will ensure to exclude any particles.
3. **Encourage the student** to think critically about how to form the sentence in Romanian by prompting them to consider:
   - The appropriate particles to use that fit the context.
   - The correct conjugation and tense for verbs based on the subject and context.
   - Word order and sentence structure in Romanian.
4. **Provide clues and questions** that can help lead the student to the correct translation without giving away the answer.
5. **Foster a collaborative and supportive learning environment** where the student feels encouraged to engage with the language actively. 

Now, I’m ready to assist with any English sentence you’d like to translate into Romanian!

Bears are at the door

Assistant
Great sentence for translation! Let’s break it down together. Here’s a vocabulary table to help you:

- bears: urși
- door: ușă
- at: (You’ll need to find the correct preposition for "at" in Romanian.)

Now, consider the following:

1. **Think about the subject "bears."** How would you express that in Romanian? Remember to consider the plural form.
2. **"Are" indicates a present tense verb.** What verb would you use for "to be" in Romanian when you're referring to multiple subjects?
3. **For the word "at,"** you’ll need to decide which preposition to use in this context. What do you think would be appropriate for "at the door"?

Feel free to give it a try, and let me know what you come up with!

Urs la usa

Assistant
You're very close! "Urs la ușă" translates to "Bear at door," but remember that "bears" is plural in your original sentence. So we want to reflect that in Romanian.

Here are a few things to adjust:

1. **Make sure to use the plural form:** Instead of "urs," use the correct plural form for "bears."
2. **Don't forget the verb "are":** You need to include the appropriate form of the verb "to be" for the plural subject.

So, try again! What would the revised sentence look like using the tips provided?

Bears are at the door!

Assistant
Great job on your sentence! Let's break it down step by step. Here's a vocabulary table to help you get started:

- bears: urși
- door: ușă
- at: la

Now, let's think about the sentence structure in Romanian. How would you say "bears are at" in Romanian? And how would you say "the door" in Romanian?

urs este la usa

Fantastic! You're on the right track. "Urs este la usa" is a great translation for "bears are at the door."


Just a small note, when we refer to "urși" in Romanian, we usually use the plural form. So the correct translation should be "Urșii sunt la ușă" to indicate that we're talking about multiple bears.


Keep up the great work! Is there anything else you would like to practice?

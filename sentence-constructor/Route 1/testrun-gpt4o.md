Guidance:

    "Bears are at the door"
        "Urs" is singular. How would you form the plural?
        "To be" (a fi) needs to be conjugated in the present tense for a plural subject.
        What preposition would you use to indicate location ("at the door")?

    "Did you leave the garbage out?"
        This is a past tense question. How do you conjugate "a lăsa" for "you" in the past?
        Romanian often places the past tense auxiliary before the verb—do you remember how that works?
        "Out" in this context means "outside"—what’s the best Romanian equivalent?

You're on the right track, but let's refine it a bit! 😊
Corrections & Clues:

    "Bears" → "Urs" is singular, but you need the plural form. Do you remember how to form the plural of nouns ending in a consonant? (Hint: The plural of "urs" is "urși" 🐻🐻).

    "Are" → Since "urși" is plural, "este" (which is singular) isn't the right conjugation. What’s the correct form of "a fi" for "they are"?

    "At the door" → "La ușă" is close, but Romanian often uses "ușa" instead of "ușă" when referring to a specific door.
